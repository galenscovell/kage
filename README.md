# Kage

After struggling to find the perfect language learning tool focused specifically on listening/speaking, I've decided to just make my own.

Kage is a simple tool that takes in audio clips from any source, assembles them into sets, and presents them to you in a manner similar to Glossika using spaced repetition.

### Setup
* `npm install` in root directory
* `npm start` to launch
* `npm run dist` to create new package
